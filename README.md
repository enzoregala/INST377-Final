# The target audience for this project were PC users in the internet who are NBA fans.
# The app allows users to input a team and the app will return a list of the players in the team, along with their height and weight
# In the footer, users can access a file to check the team names to input

# The API used was API-NBA: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba
